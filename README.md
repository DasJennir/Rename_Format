# Rename_Format

## What is this script used for:

This tool is used to change the format of files that ends with a certain format in the currently directory.

For example if you have 10 files with the .html format and you wish to change to .txt format you simply run this command and insert the wished format 

**Reminder that when the script asks for the format, do not write it with a dot, only the format is necessary so instead of '.html' you should write only 'html'**
